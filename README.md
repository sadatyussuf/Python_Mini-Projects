## Advent Of Code

---

The `Advent Of Code` folder contains my solutions to coding challenges from the Advent of Code website. Each year, the Advent of Code releases a series of coding challenges that get progressively more difficult. I have completed the challenges for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 and stored my solutions in this folder.

## Exercism Challenge

---

The `Exercism Challenge` folder contains my solutions to coding challenges from the Exercism website. Exercism is a platform that provides coding challenges in various programming languages and provides feedback on your solutions. I have completed challenges in several languages, including Python, Java, and C++, and stored my solutions in this folder.

## Basic Web Application

---

The `Basic Web Application` folder contains a simple web application that I built using Python Flask. The application allows users to input a city name and returns the current temperature and weather conditions for that city. The project also includes unit tests to ensure the application functions correctly.

## Weather App

---

The `Weather App` folder contains a more advanced version of the basic web application. This application is built using React and Node.js and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Users can input a city name and the application displays the current weather conditions, as well as a 5-day forecast. The project also includes integration tests to ensure the application functions correctly.

The underlining markdown code is simply a series of dashes (`-`) that span the same length as the text they underline. In Markdown, using a line of dashes like this creates a horizontal line that separates different sections of the document, such as headings and subheadings.
